        <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
        <p>This recipe will help you cook <strong>authentic Italian Pasta Carbonara</strong>. I've been cooking this dish 
        for a couple of years since my vacation in Italy. This dish uses only a few traditional Italian ingredients but the techniques
        used cooking them makes this dish more complicated than it looks.</p>

        <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
        <p><ul>
            <li>Spaghetti, prefered amount for four portions</li>
            <li>Guanciale, 150g (you can use Pancetta or american bacon as replacement)</li>
            <li>Parmesan, 80g</li>
            <li>Pecorino 80g</li>
            <li>Eggs, 4pc (we will be using 3 egg yolks and 1 whole egg)</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Freshly ground Black Pepper</li>
            <li>Cooking oil (preferably olive oil)</li>
            <li>(Optional: Fresh Thyme and garlic)</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p><h2>Recipe</h2></p>
        <p><ol>
            <li>Start by bringing water to a boil for your pasta. I usually use a quite large quantity of water for cooking pasta.
                Salt the pasta water generously since we will be using it to thicken our sauce later on. Cook your pasta until 'al dente'
                What this means is basically cook your pasta to a point where it still has a somewhat noticeable bite. Usually this takes
                around 8-10 minutes in my experiance, but you should monitor this by tasting! <strong>Remember not to drain your pasta water
                down the sink!</strong>
            </li>
            <li>In a large skillet, start cooking your prefered meat over medium-high heat. The goal is to render the fat from the meat
                and then fry it slowly.
                
                <p>Tip: You can infuse more flavor into the dish before adding the meat
                by heating a little bit of olive oil in the skillet and lightly sauteing sliced garlic cloves and fresh thyme in it.
                When aromatic and slightly toasted, remove the herbs and garlic. Then continue on with the recipe.</p>
            </li>
            <li>While the pasta and bacon are cooking, grate and mix the cheeses together with 2-3 egg yolks and 1 whole egg. Season the mixture with
                salt and black pepper. This is the base for our pasta sauce.
            </li>
            <li>When the bacon has cooked and caramellized nicely, bring the heat down to medium-low. Add your pasta and mix the ingredients together.
                After this bring the heat further down to low and add the sauce. <strong>The heat needs to be low enough so the eggs don't turn into scrambled
                ones.</strong> Mix continuosly and add pasta water in small parts. The starchy pasta water together with the cheese, eggs and fat from the meat
                should start emulsifying into a nice sauce.
            </li>
            <li>After grounding some black pepper on top, you are all set to eat!</li>
